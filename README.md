# Federated Learning And Federated Mix

## Contributions 
This repo was built by [Luca Marcellino](https://github.com/LucaMarcellino), [Luca Villani](https://github.com/lucavillanigit) and [Edoardo Bonelli](https://github.com/wh33li3). We worked all together to guarantee the best possible results.

## Content

In this repository you will find different implementation of the Federated Learning methods. First you can find an implementation related to the FederatedAVG and another related to FedGKT.

Finally you can find two possible new implementation, to the best of our knowledge, that we called **Federated Mix** and **Federared Adaptive**.

## Federated Mix

This implementation is based on FedAvg but with an important difference. Indeed the latter method implement or Batch Norm or Gruop Norm. In our method we tried to merge both normalizations using a linear combinations.
